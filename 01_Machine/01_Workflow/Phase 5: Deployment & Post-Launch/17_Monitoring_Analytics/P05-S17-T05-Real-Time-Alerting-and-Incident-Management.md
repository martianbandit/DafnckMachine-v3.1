# Mission Statement
Implement a real-time alerting system and establish robust incident management procedures to proactively address issues in DafnckMachine v3.1.

# Description
This task covers the implementation of an alerting system, configuration of alert rules, setup of notification channels, definition of escalation procedures, and integration with incident response workflows. It also includes establishing formal incident response procedures, escalation workflows, communication protocols, and post-incident analysis processes.

# Super-Prompt
You are @health-monitor-agent. Your mission is to implement a real-time alerting system and incident management for DafnckMachine v3.1, ensuring proactive detection, rapid response, and robust escalation. Document all alerting and incident management procedures with clear guidelines and best practices.

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Alerting System Implementation
- **ID**: P05-S17-T05-S01
- **Description**: Implement an alerting system by configuring alert rules, setting up notification channels, defining escalation procedures, and integrating with incident response workflows.
- **Agent**: @health-monitor-agent
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Alerting_System_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/Alerting_System_Implementation.md)
  - [Incident_Management_Framework.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/Incident_Management_Framework.json)
- **Steps**:
  1. Configure alerting system rules and notification channels in Incident_Management_Framework.json, including alert rule definitions, notification channel setups, escalation procedures, and incident response integrations.
     - Tool: edit_file
     - Success Criteria:
       - File Exists: 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/Incident_Management_Framework.json
       - File Content Matches: Contains configurations for 'alertRules', 'notificationChannels', 'escalationProcedures', 'incidentResponseIntegration'
  2. Set up the alerting system based on Alerting_System_Implementation.md and configured rules.
     - Tool: run_terminal_cmd
     - Success Criteria:
       - Exit Code: 0
       - Output Contains: Alerting system setup successful
       - Test Alert Received: Test alert triggered and received via configured notification channels
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: A comprehensive alerting system is implemented with defined rules, notification channels, escalation procedures, and integration with incident management.
- **Integration Points**: The alerting system enables proactive detection of issues, triggering incident response workflows for rapid resolution.
- **Next Subtask**: P05-S17-T05-S02

## Subtask 2: Incident Response & Escalation
- **ID**: P05-S17-T05-S02
- **Description**: Establish formal incident response procedures, define escalation workflows, set up communication protocols, and implement post-incident analysis processes.
- **Agent**: @health-monitor-agent
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Incident_Response_Procedures.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/Incident_Response_Procedures.md)
  - [Escalation_Workflows.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/Escalation_Workflows.json)
- **Steps**:
  1. Document incident response procedures and escalation workflows in Incident_Response_Procedures.md and Escalation_Workflows.json respectively. This includes communication protocols and post-incident analysis guidelines.
     - Tool: edit_file
     - Success Criteria:
       - File Exists: 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/Incident_Response_Procedures.md
       - File Exists: 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/Escalation_Workflows.json
       - File Content Matches: Incident_Response_Procedures.md contains sections for 'Response Steps', 'Communication Protocols', 'Post-Incident Analysis'
       - File Content Matches: Escalation_Workflows.json defines escalation tiers and triggers
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Comprehensive incident response procedures, escalation workflows, communication protocols, and post-incident analysis guidelines are documented and established.
- **Integration Points**: Ensures rapid and coordinated issue resolution, minimizing impact and facilitating learning from incidents.
- **Next Subtask**: P05-S17-T06-S01
